high priority
=============

Fix generated code so that unknown proto fields are collected into a data
structure.

Remove all references to the BASE package in generated code.  Make generated
files independently loadable.

Add more tests for merging from a protobuf instance.  Use Stefil??

Implement extensions
  Add tests

Look at all XXXX comments in the compiler source and remove them.
  involves filing some bugs against C++ code

Update C++ Google protobuf compiler source to latest version.

Use base::vector-index or elimineate it.  It's not in package.lisp.


General stuff
=============

5. read the binary description of a protocol buffer into RAM
   output S-expression protobuf forms
   Compare output to S-expression backend of compiler on all Google protobufs.
   Talk to Kenton about which approach he prefers -- backend or binary reader.

6. read S-expression protobuf forms
   create internal protobuf data structures that represent the messages
   generate Lisp code that uses proto form to read and write binary data
   generate Lisp code that directly reads and writes binary data

Look at the Java unit tests for unittest.proto
  Maybe the Java semantics are what we want, since protos are more
  immutable in the Java world.

What do we do with strings?
  Some are declared as byte(octet) arrays, others as strings.

add slick check-several bits code to clear / is-initialized

implement RPC service stubs ??


protobuf
========

move more unit test code from google-protobuf/src/google/protobuf into protobuf

review proto-lisp-test code ... remove it ?

move the package decl for protocol-buffer into each compiled file?
  would be nice of users could just load a compiled protobuf

pick a testing framework
Port the tests to the unit test framework.
look at all tests in google-protobuf/src/google/protobuf
  start migrating them here

create a testing directory?

Figure out a strategy for specifying Common Lisp optimization levels and
apply it uniformally.  There's some support for this in optimize.lisp, and
there are some #+opt conditionalizations sprinkled around the code.

Currently, all classes that implement protocol buffers are placed in the
Lisp package PROTOCOL-BUFFER.  Is this the right approach?


google-protobuf
===============

primitive field octet size and serialize do not work with packed
repeated data ... 
    search for "packed" in at lease cpp_primitive_field.cc and
    cpp_enum_field.cc

add extensions and other features needed to load protobuf files

add README file to the top level explaining the Lisp changes

merge in latest Google changes


other
=====

Implement a protocol buffer compiler.  There are several ways to do this.
Here are my favorites:

  a. Implement a new backend for Google's protocol buffer compiler that
  generates CLOS classes from protobuf descriptions.  It is unlikely that
  Google will integrate this change into their code, and it requires Lisp
  developers to use Google's protobuf syntax.

  b. Implement a new backend for Google's protocol buffer compiler that
  outputs protobuf descriptions in s-expression form.  Write a compiler in
  Lisp that translates the s-expressions into CLOS classes.  Google may be
  more receptive to integrating this change into their code, since it is
  useful for any language in the Lisp family.  Also, the change is much
  smaller, amounting to just a pretty printer.  Lisp developers can write
  protobuf descriptions as s-expressions.  The disadvantage is that this
  approach is a bit more work.

  c. Implement a compiler via either of the methods above that converts
  protobuf descriptions into run-time data structures.  The programmer
  decides which protobufs are translated into code at compile time and which
  are translated at run time.  In the second case, the CLOS generic
  functions for a protobuf would just be small stubs.  When they are ever
  called, they replace themselves with the right access code.
